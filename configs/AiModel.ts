Each object represents a scene:\n\n* **`imagePrompt`**: This field contains the AI image generation prompt designed for a realistic style.  The descriptions are detailed to guide the AI towards generating relevant and visually appealing images.  The specific wording may need adjustments depending on the AI model used (e.g., Midjourney, Dall-E 2, Stable Diffusion).\n\n* **`ContentText`**: This field contains the narration or text that would accompany each scene in the video.  These short sentences aim to be concise and impactful within the 30-second timeframe.\n\n\n**To create the video:**\n\n1. **Generate Images:** Use an AI image generator (like Midjourney, Dall-E 2, or Stable Diffusion) and input each `imagePrompt`.  You\'ll obtain a set of images.\n\n2. **Video Editing:** Use a video editing software (like Adobe Premiere Pro, DaVinci Resolve, or even simpler tools like iMovie or Kapwing). Import the generated images and add the corresponding `ContentText` as narration or subtitles.  Add transitions and music to improve the flow.\n\n3. **Timing:** Ensure that each scene is appropriately timed to fit within the 30-second limit.  You may need to adjust the number of scenes or the length of each scene.\n\n\n**Note:** The realistic style of the images will depend heavily on the AI model and its parameters. Experiment with different keywords and settings to achieve the desired visual quality.  You might need to iterate on the prompts to get the best results.\n',
